# Sign_Stream   Deep learning system for real time Indian sign language generation
## ABOUT
 SignStream is a project aiming to bridge the communication gap between deaf and non-signing individuals. It utilizes real-time translation by converting spoken or written English sentences into Indian Sign Language (ISL) animations and potentially vice versa in the future.
## FEATURES
- Real-time Translation: SignStream provides seamless translation between spoken or written English and Indian Sign Language (ISL) in real-time, facilitating instant communication.
- Two Input Methods: Users can interact with the system through either speech recognition (converting spoken English to text) or text input (typing the sentence they want translated).
- Educational Integration: SignStream can be integrated into educational institutions, providing a platform for students to learn sign language effectively.
## REQUIREMENTS
### Hardware Requirements
